        "description": "Holographic displays serve to facilitate the investigation and visualization of complex 3D models. Modern displays are expensive and lack user interaction. A high price point results in a high barrier of entry for consumers in industries such as medicine, engineering, and education, who could otherwise benefit greatly from this technology. HoloView provides an intuitive and inexpensive all-in-one solution with user interaction and multi-platform support. This will facilitate the adoption and enhance the capabilities of holographic technology in commercial, industrial, and academic applications.",

        "description": "A large amount of power is wasted when electronic devices are absent-mindedly left on or idling in standby. The objective of JouleBox is to save consumers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 money and conserve energy while introducing a degree of automation. This can be achieved by designing a smart power-bar which can monitor and control power flow to various devices, and provide users with various reports and recommendations through a graphic user interface. The JouleBox will also offer a Bluetooth based presence detection system to enable completely autonomous power control.",

This will be used to improve coordination between human and robot workers, reducing collisions. Sub-meter precision is achieved using anchored beacons that communicate with moving client devices. The obtained geometric coordinates are forwarded from clients to a location processing server, which calculates the likelihood of imminent collision between two entities. These coordinates are saved to a database and accessible via API for future analysis to eliminate workplace hazards.",

        "description": "Due to the frequent phenomenon of non-profit organizations' embezzling donations, the public's trust in charities is substantially reduced. This project is to design a decentralized system that guarantees the transparency and security of the donation processes. The system achieves transactional transparency using blockchain paired with distributed computing. Cryptography is applied to guarantee the security of the system. The main advantage of this design is that it enhances charities' credibility and stimulates the public's enthusiasm for charity while being transparent and secure.",
